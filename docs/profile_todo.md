      "description": "Winner of a league season",

## Plan (Order of Implementation)
1) Backend public profile endpoint (core data)
2) Backend badge system endpoints (CRUD operations)
3) Frontend public profile page (basic layout)
4) Frontend badge display components (reusable)
5) Frontend medal integration in leaderboards
6) Frontend admin badge management UI
7) Polish and testing

## Notes
- Public profiles should be accessible without authentication
- Badge icons can use Lucide React icons initially (trophy, star, fire, etc.)
- Medal assets should be SVG or PNG with proper licensing
- Consider badge earning automation (e.g., "First Victory" on first win)
- League rankings should show current position and historical best

- Recent matches should be limited to last 10-20 for performance
